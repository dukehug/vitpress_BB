# Changelog



This file records notable user-facing and maintenance changes to BB Better Layout. Release entries use the version from `manifest.json` and the date format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Unreleased



- Open existing Study Note notes in Preview by default while keeping newly created notes ready to edit in Write mode.

## v2.12.3 - 2026-08-29



- Match the Dashboard navigation drawer, legal footer links, and collapse control to the active Appearance instead of exposing Blackboard's native dark footer background.

## v2.12.2 - 2026-08-29



- Replace Rose Reading with a brighter Cute Pink Appearance while preserving accessible reading contrast.
- Open Blackboard's native Your Courses switcher from the Courses shortcut on single-course pages without changing Course Content or Roster search behavior.
- Add Arrow Up/Down result selection, Enter navigation, and Escape closing to the Your Courses search field.
- Center the native Your Courses dialog and match its surfaces, text, borders, tabs, results, and selected states to the active Appearance.
- Fix the themed Your Courses search field and its focus-state label mask so the background, floating label, caret, and typed text remain readable in every Appearance.

## v2.12.1 - 2026-08-15



- Add a dependency-free Markdown editor to Study Note with Write and Preview modes, a formatting toolbar, keyboard shortcuts, and safe DOM-based rendering.
- Support headings, emphasis, strikethrough, links, quotes, ordered and unordered lists, task lists, code blocks, horizontal rules, and tables in Study Note previews.
- Display incomplete and completed task boxes reliably inside Blackboard, and strike through completed task text.
- Convert a selected HTTP(S) or mailto URL into a Markdown link while keeping the link label selected for immediate editing.
- Add a one-time Markdown writing example to Quick Notes without recreating it after the user deletes it.
- Change Study Note JSON import from replacement to append-only merging, add CSV backup import, reuse matching notebook names, and regenerate colliding IDs instead of overwriting local data.
- Enable Show Study Note and Show Weekly Schedule by default for installations without a saved preference while preserving an explicit disabled setting.
- Replace Schedule's imported-course-only selector with an editable course combobox that accepts manual course names and still fills course, teacher, day, and time fields from imported choices.

## v2.12.0 - 2026-08-15



- Add an optional device-local weekly Schedule workspace to Blackboard's main side panel.
- Add an options-page switch that enables or disables Schedule without deleting saved timetable data.
- Import course codes, names, meeting days, meeting times, and instructor details only after the user clicks Import on the Blackboard Courses page.

- Add an options-page switch that hides or shows custom links without deleting their saved configuration.

- Validate stored and submitted links, reject non-HTTP(S) destinations, and open accepted links in a separate tab with opener isolation.
- Update custom links immediately when synchronized extension settings change, including during Blackboard SPA navigation.
- Keep the Dashboard navigation scrollable when additional links exceed the available viewport height.
- Bundle the Apache-2.0 Google Material Icons font locally for the options-page icon picker.

## v2.10.5 - 2026-08-15
